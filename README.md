# Examples for Yosys Synthesis and Equivalence Verification

- Yosys is an OpenSource Tool mainly for Synthesis, but also provides equivalence checks

- Comparing two Verilog Designs
- Comparing Verilog against VHDL
  - Using GHDL and ghdl-yosys-plugin

## Examples

### formal

Some testcases to work with equivalence check in Yosys,

* based on Yosys Isse #639, with some modifications.
* Register Files

### synth

Some examples using the Yosys GHDL plugin
